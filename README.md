# Goals

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the relevance of using a script debounce to ensure that resize events are triggered correctly

[Demo](http://jfroffice.github.com/jquery.trueresize/demo/) (Do not forget to resize the browser window for at least 3 seconds)

# How to bind resize event ?

```javascript
$(window).on('trueresize', function() {
    // do your job here
});
```
